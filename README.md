# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game
This is my first project ever since I started learning programming
It is the very common game Rock Paper Scissors, where the user can choose how many rounds to play, and then choose between the three options: rock paper scissors. When computer then chooses an option too but randomly, and shows the result of every round and colors the screen accordingly. At the end of the game, the computer shows the whole game results and asks the user if they want to play again.
